OSU Psychology Department Experiment - Assessing humans' appraisal of uncertainty.

The experiment consists of many trials of a smooth square 'terrain', with a randomly generated surface with Gaussian kernel, which is overlain with a grid. Only few of the squares of the grid are revealed to show the underlying value of the surface at those points. Subjects are then asked to guess the value of the surface at some unknown points on the same terrain, and asked which of those guesses they are most uncertain of. Subjects' view of uncertainty would then be contrasted with the true uncertainty (maximum variance) of a zero-mean prior Gaussian Process trained on the same known data points revealed to the subjects.
