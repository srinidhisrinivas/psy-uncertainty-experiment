You finished training! You are now ready to estimate some unknown terrains!

For each region, enter your estimate for the height of the terrain in the empty spaces as before.

CAUTION: You are being scored on your performance! However, the company will allow you to waive one

ONE of your answers to waive and click 'Next' to move on to the next region!
