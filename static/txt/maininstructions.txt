Welcome to your new assignment!

You are taking over for our previous terrain scout. Your task is to estimate the height of the
terrain at certain unknown points in the region. You will do this by entering a number in each empty
space in the region. You must use the height of the terrain at the points available to you to
estimate the height of the unknown points.

In the beginning, our former terrain scout, who is very experienced, will be training you to
estimate the height of the terrain at the uncertain points by providing corrections to your guesses.

Once you are through the training phase, you will be asked to estimate some new terrains that we are
yet to map, and assess how confident you are about your estimates.

Good luck!
